  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>

  <p>
    Hello siblings! This email contains nothing of importance. BUT, it is a huge accomplishment in the pre-work for my class! I composed/coded this email in a text editor, built a javascript file that customized the email for everyone, and sent this email to you from a command line in my computer terminal! Wahooo :) See below for the default email content (which I did not write):

    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= monthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and am having a great time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
    Look at my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].link.href %>><%= latestPosts[i].title %></li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Talk soon,<br>
